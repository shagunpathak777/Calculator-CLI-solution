Task Title: Calculator CLI App
Objective:
Create a command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations using Python.

Tools Used:
Python, VS Code

Description:
I built a simple command-line calculator in Python.
The program uses separate functions for each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It takes user input using input(), performs the selected operation, and runs continuously inside a while loop until the user chooses the exit option.

The calculator displays a menu with choices from 1 to 5:
1 → Addition
2 → Subtraction
3 → Multiplication
4 → Division
5 → Exit

The program also includes handling for division by zero.
The output is shown after every operation, and the loop continues until the user selects option 5.

Deliverable:
A Python script named calculator.py.
